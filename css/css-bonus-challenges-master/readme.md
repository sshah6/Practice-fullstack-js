# CSS Bonus Challenges

This repo contains various example UI's that may be used to practice HTML and CSS styling. The UI's are roughly grouped by level of complexity. No CSS frameworks should be used. Using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and SASS will be helpful but not required. For determining colors, if using a Mac, use the Digital Color Meter to determine the correct color. Again, no CSS frameworks should be used but building a custom grid system may be helpful. 

Each example UI contains images needed, a list of formal specifications, and in some cases, a GIF to illustrate functionality. Additional fonts and icons may need to be imported.
